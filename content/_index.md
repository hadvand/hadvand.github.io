# hi there!
In my 2 years of experience in software engineering I have tried many things:
- full-stack development
- kubernetes management
- data processing
- machine learning
- architecture design

I will not dare to say that I am a specialist in any of these fields, but man does it feel good learning new stuff :D

I studied for my bachelor's degree in CompSci at Brno Technical University, then tried myself at a few real projects and currently am working for Solarwinds in Kubernetes Observability team.

Also having some projects on the side, visiting conferences and hackathons, and trying myself in contributing to open-source.

In my free time you can also find me reaching new *heights* at my local climbing gym, wrestling or watching some old tv-show that I've already seen 5 times.

Reach out to me if you have any questions or a cool project idea! You can find my socials down below.
