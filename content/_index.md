# hi there!
In my 2 years of experience in software engineering I have tried many things:
- full-stack development
- kubernetes infra
- data processing & ML

Most of my time went into web development, and I will not dare to say that I am a specialist in any of these fields, but man does it feel good learning new stuff :D

I studied for my bachelor's degree in CompSci at Brno Technical University, then tried myself at a few real projects and currently am working for Solarwinds in Kubernetes Observability team

Also having some projects on the side, visiting conferences and hackathons, and trying myself in contributing to open-source

Outside of work, I’m either climbing, wrestling, or rewatching an old favorite TV show for the 5th time
